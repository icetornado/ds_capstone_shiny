# Data Science Capstone

This capstone project is a project of the final class of "Data Science Specialization" track offered by John Hopkins/Coursera.  It captures of ability to create a usable/public data product that can be used to show the data scientist skills.

The capstone is based on the following thoughts:
- Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. When someone types: "I went to the ", the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be. For example, the three words might be gym, store, restaurant. The project starts from understanding to building predictive text models like those used by SwiftKey.

- This work process of the project will start with the basics, analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. It will cover cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, a complete data product will be built a predictive text product.
